Industrial crisis? Not for the States!

While Europe's industry is in ruins, US industry is going through an actual manufacturing boom.

This translates into billion-dollar facilities projects even in small towns.

Spending on manufacturing construction projects in the US reached an annualized $198 billion in August, up nearly 66% from the previous year and the highest since the Bureau of Economic Analysis began tracking this data in the 1950s.

The excitement promises to bring investment and good-paying jobs to areas that desperately need them. But with it comes concerns about the availability of infrastructure to support the new factories, as well as fears about changing the structure of the surrounding population.

Earlier we reported that manufacturers in Europe are moving production to the US en masse. The main reasons are rising energy and logistics costs.
