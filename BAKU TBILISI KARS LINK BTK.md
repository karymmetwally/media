The opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway in 2017 was a significant step in implementing the Middle Corridor. Over the years, changing geopolitical conditions have significantly affected the relevance of the BTK, prompting practical measures to expand its capacity, as well as other infrastructures.

Work on developing the Middle Corridor route is ongoing and the completion of several projects is expected in 2024 that will increase the capacity of the route and speed of delivery. All work on the BTK route should be completed in the first quarter of this year. After modernisation and expansion, the BTK route is predicted to handle up to 5mn tonnes of cargo.

Investment co-operation with Azerbaijan will allow the completion of the Marabda-Turkey border section of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway in Georgia soon. Additionally, logistic terminals will be constructed in Akhalkalaki and Kars, which will increase the cargo volumes of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway.
