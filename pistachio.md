Pistachio and walnut shells, often wasted during food processing, contain valuable components. Researchers used subcritical water technology to extract these components in an environmentally friendly way. They compared this method with conventional extraction using organic solvents. The subcritical water method yielded extracts rich in bioactive compounds like phenols and flavonoids. It also produced high antioxidant activity. Additionally, it extracted sugars and their derivatives effectively. This study suggests that subcritical water technology is more efficient for extracting valuable components from biowaste compared to traditional methods, while also producing useful byproducts.
