There are also problems with rail transport in Turkey, where the capacity is very low – up to 700,000 tpy – forcing cargo to be transferred to road transport, which increases delivery time and leads to additional costs. 

Constructing a railway from Ankara to the border with Georgia would make the Middle Corridor an indispensable route, and the delivery time of goods through Turkey would be reduced from eight days to just two.
