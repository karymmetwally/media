Azerbaijan as a Middle Corridor node

In November 2023 President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan approved the "Action Plan for Increasing the Transit Potential of International Transport Corridors Passing Through the Territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Stimulating Transit Freight Transportation for 2024-2026." The plan envisages implementing various measures to strengthen and develop the transport-logistics sector and the country's transit potential.

Currently Azerbaijan's priority in this plan is the Middle Corridor, considered the most reliable, stable and secure route for transcontinental logistics across Eurasia.
