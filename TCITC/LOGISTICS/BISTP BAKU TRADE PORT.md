The appeal of using Azerbaijan as a transit point is also increased by the Baku International Sea Trade Port, the largest port on the Caspian Sea. Currently the development of the master plan for the construction of the port's second phase is underway. Upon completion, the port's capacity will increase from 15 to 25mn tonnes per year (tpy) of cargo, and the TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) trans-shipment capacity will reach 500,000 per year.

Azerbaijan has its own shipbuilding yard. Although the country possesses the largest trading fleet on the Caspian, the construction of new vessels – tankers and dry cargo ships – continues to increase the cargo turnover capabilities of the maritime segment of the multi-modal Middle Corridor. Plans include enhancing the capacities of the Baku shipyard, which will build up to 20 ships a year, considering the growing need for maritime cargo transportation.
