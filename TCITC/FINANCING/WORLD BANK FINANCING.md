World Bank recommendations

In November last year, the World Bank issued a report titled "The Middle Trade and Transport Corridor" which highlights priority measures that could assist Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia in transforming this multimodal rail-maritime corridor into a significant and reliable transcontinental trade route.

The report identifies key strategic decisions and investments necessary to meet the demand for transport services and support economic development in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. 

These include: 

+ providing logistical solutions along the entire corridor to ensure smooth operation; 
+ reforming and simplifying processes and procedures; 
+ synchronising digital solutions; 
+ enhancing operational efficiency in transportation across the Caspian and Black Seas; 
+ and aligning a unified system of investment prioritisation.

The World Bank also identified five main factors limiting the capacity of the Middle Corridor and its bottlenecks. These are: 

+ coordination and management of the corridor
+ bottlenecks in ports
+  maritime services, 
+ railway system 
+ border crossing points

 All of which are related to issues in data and information exchange. 
 
 
According to World Bank experts, resolving these issues will require significant investment. 

However, it should be taken into account that improving efficiency can yield substantial and immediate benefits.

It seems that the Middle Corridor has good prospects. 

As the World Bank notes, substantial and immediate benefits from the operation of the route depend on the diligence and perseverance of the countries in the region. 

To maintain interest in the Middle Corridor, it must be maximally efficient. 

And there is still work to be done on this.
