Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia have agreed on a five-year roadmap for the development of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Corridor until 2027. 

This marks the creation of the largest joint logistics company in the history of these countries. 

The new structure will focus on standardising tariffs and processing all goods transiting through the Middle Corridor.

The primary goal of the company is to facilitate cargo transportation between China and Europe. 

The participating countries are committed to simplifying all processes significantly and reducing cargo delivery times. 

+ Initially, the transit time along the Middle Corridor route was 53 days; 
+ it has now been reduced to 18-23 days, 
+ and the activities of the new company are expected to further decrease this to 18, 
+ and eventually to 10-15 days.

The "roadmap" adopted by the three countries aims to expand cargo transportation through the Middle Corridor to 10mn tpy by 2025, up from 6mn tpy.

China has shown great interest in implementing the Middle Corridor. 

Previously, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China noted that China would participate in the creation of this route. 

Recently, a delegation from the Chinese port of Qingdao visited the Baku International Sea Trade Port, where collaboration in the development of port infrastructure and increasing the volume of cargo transported through Azerbaijan were discussed. 

Last year, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Port of Baku and the Port of Qingdao.

It has recently been announced that European and international financial institutions plan to allocate €10bn for the development of transport communication in Central Asia. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, stated that international partners are committed to providing €10bn in investments for the development of sustainable transport communication in Central Asia, including new commitments from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank amounting to €1.5bn.

+ modern, 
+ competitive with suez canal, 
+ sustainable, 
+ predictable, 
+ smart 
+ and high-speed route

 connecting Europe with Central Asia in 15 days or less."
