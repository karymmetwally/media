### US is not making AI chips on premises today, minister says

The US lags behind China in terms of investment in the development and production of semiconductors, despite the US administration's adoption of the "Chip Act", the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo stated at a hearing of the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology.

The US currently does not produce a single advanced chip on its home soil, she added.

And according to Raimondo, even chips coming under the brand of US company Nvidia are "every single one of them made in Taiwan".

The minister also pointed out that there was "no need to explain to anyone in the audience" about the risks associated with Taiwan or China.

In 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the "Chips and Science Act," the point of which is to accelerate the country's establishment of full-cycle production of complex logistics chips that are still being imported from Taiwan.
